# Summarizer Testing for QuickEase

This project demonstrates a summarizer tool using code from [OpenAI's Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/summarizing_long_documents).

## Steps to Use

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
First, create a virtual environment with the following command:

```bash
$ python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate your virtual environment:

- **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
- **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

> If you're having trouble activating the virtual environment, [check this link for alternative methods](https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv).

### 3. Install Dependencies
After activating the virtual environment, install the required dependencies from the `req.txt` file:

```bash
$ pip install -r req.txt
```

### 4. Run the Summarizer
Once the dependencies are installed, you're ready to use the summarizer script:

```bash
$ python summarizer.py
```

### 5. View the Output
The output of the program will be saved in the `contents.html` file.
