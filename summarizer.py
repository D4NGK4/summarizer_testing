            You are an experienced tutor preparing a student for an important exam. Your task is to create a detailed, well-organized summary notes that covers the whole provided material. The summary should be:

            - Concise (Eliminate repetitive points)
            - Objective (Avoid introducing personal biases, and stick to the facts as presented in the original content)
            - Clarity (Structuring sentences in a straightforward manner)
            - Coherence (Maintain a logical sequence, often following the structure of the original content)
            - Lastly, use Extractive Summary (do not rephrase) especially in important concepts, and terms and definitions.
            - You may use Abstractive Summary (rephrasing words using Layman's Terms) in Introduction and Overview Summary only.

            The summary notes should follow this structure:
            - **Introduction**
            - **Multiple Key Concepts**
            - **Overview Summary**

            ### Guidelines for Introduction:
            - Should be 1 paragraph only containing 3 sentences (minimum) to 5 sentences (maximum) long.
            - Clearly state the objective of the summary notes.
            - Should highlight the key areas that the summary notes will cover.
            - Mention the importance to the reader.

            ### Guidelines for Key Concepts:
            - Core Ideas
            - Terms and Definitions (Include even the sub-bullets or sub-points)
            - Provide only one that fits each core idea, either (Real-Life Application or Analogy) to better understand the Key Concepts

            ### Guidelines for Overview Summary:
            - Should be one paragraph only containing 3 sentences (minimum) to 5 sentences (maximum) long.
            - Contains the final thoughts that encapsulate the entire summary note.

            ### Important Instruction:
            - **RESPOND ONLY IN HTML FORMAT** but **DO NOT include** the `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, or `<body>` tags. Use appropriate HTML tags to structure the content with headings, lists, and paragraphs. Maintain the logical sequence and structure provided, and ensure each section is clearly defined.

            Here is the example format of the response:

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This summary note is designed to provide a clear and structured overview of security and access control in system administration and maintenance. It covers essential principles such as least privilege, separation of duties, user authentication and authorization, system hardening, monitoring, incident response, and compliance. These concepts are crucial for maintaining secure systems, ensuring appropriate access levels, and responding effectively to security incidents. Understanding these key areas is critical for system administrators and IT professionals to safeguard organizational data and infrastructure.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <h3>1. Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This is where a third-party provider offers disaster recovery solutions via the cloud. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2. Principles of Security and Access Control</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Least Privilege</strong>: Users are given only the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks, reducing the risk of damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Separation of Duties</strong>: Different individuals perform different administrative tasks to prevent conflicts of interest and abuse.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Real-Life Application</em>: Like restricting access to sensitive documents to only relevant employees to avoid data leaks.</p>

            <h3>3. Incident Response and Recovery</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Incident Response Plan</strong>: A structured approach to handling security breaches, including:
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Identification</strong>: Recognizing the incident.</li>
                <li><strong>Containment</strong>: Minimizing the damage.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Backup and Recovery</strong>: Regular data backups and recovery procedures ensure systems can be restored in case of failure or data loss.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>Analogy</em>: An incident response plan is like a fire drill planâ€”clear roles and actions minimize harm during an emergency.</p>

            <h2>Overview Summary</h2>
            <p>This summary provides a comprehensive guide to the core principles of security and access control in system administration and maintenance. Key areas like user authentication, system hardening, and incident response are vital for maintaining secure operations and minimizing risks. Compliance with legal standards and regular auditing ensures ongoing effectiveness. A well-informed and trained team is essential to implement these strategies successfully. Understanding and applying these concepts help safeguard system integrity and protect sensitive data.</p>

    Summarizes a given text by splitting it into chunks, each of which is summarized individually. 
    The level of detail in the summary can be adjusted, and the process can optionally be made recursive.

    Parameters:
    - text (str): The text to be summarized.
    - detail (float, optional): A value between 0 and 1 indicating the desired level of detail in the summary.
      0 leads to a higher level summary, and 1 results in a more detailed summary. Defaults to 0.
    - model (str, optional): The model to use for generating summaries. Defaults to 'gpt-3.5-turbo'.
    - additional_instructions (Optional[str], optional): Additional instructions to provide to the model for customizing summaries.
    - minimum_chunk_size (Optional[int], optional): The minimum size for text chunks. Defaults to 500.
    - chunk_delimiter (str, optional): The delimiter used to split the text into chunks. Defaults to ".".
    - summarize_recursively (bool, optional): If True, summaries are generated recursively, using previous summaries for context.
    - verbose (bool, optional): If True, prints detailed information about the chunking process.

    Returns:
    - str: The final compiled summary of the text.

    The function first determines the number of chunks by interpolating between a minimum and a maximum chunk count based on the `detail` parameter. 
    It then splits the text into chunks and summarizes each chunk. If `summarize_recursively` is True, each summary is based on the previous summaries, 
    adding more context to the summarization process. The function returns a compiled summary of all chunks.

textA = ''' The post has just arrived and in it a very nice surprise, the discovery that Jacques Seguela, one-time adviser to President Mitterrand, now close confidant of President and Madame Sarkozy (indeed he intoduced them), and something of a legend in French political communications, has dedicated his latest book to little old moi. With apologies for the missing accents here and in the French bits of the long posting which follows - the dedication to 'Le Pouvoir dans la Peau' (Power in the skin) reads 'A Alastair Campbell, mon spin doctor prefere' (three missing accents in one word - mes excuses sinceres). So what did I do for this honour, you are asking? Well, perhaps the fact that he asked me to read his book, and write a 'postface' assessment both of his writing and of the issues he covers, and the fact that I said yes, has something to do with it. 
He says some blushmakingly kind things in his 'preface to the postface', which I will have to leave to French readers of the whole thing (published by Plon). But for the largely Anglophone visitors of this blog, I thought some of you might like to read the said 'postface' in English (apart from the bits where I quote direct from his book). I hope all those students who write asking for help with dissertations will find something quotable in it. Meanwhile I am off to Norway for a conference and a meeting with the Norwegian Labour Party. I'm looking forward to being in the country with the highest 'human development index' in the world, and which showed such a mature response to the recent massacre of Oslo and Utoya. Here is the postface to Le Pouvoir dans la Peau Jacques Seguela writes about political campaigns and communications not merely as an expert analyst, but as an experienced practitioner. 
Hence his latest book contains both insights worth heeding, but also enlivening tales of his own experience. He is observer and participant; outsider looking in, and insider looking out.  There is much to look at, not least in France with a Presidential election looming, and the outcome far from easy to predict.
 <break> 
We live in a world defined by the pace of change, and whilst the velocity of that change has not always impacted upon our political institutions, many of which would remain recognisable to figures of history, it most certainly has impacted upon political communications. As Seguela writes: â€˜En 5 ans le monde de la communication a plus evolue que dans les cents dernieres annees. ' Google, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook have quickly entered our language and changed the way we communicate, live our private lives, do business, do politics. People do not believe politicians as much as they once did. Nor do they believe the media. So who do we believe? We believe each other. The power and the political potential of social networks flows from that reality. Though fiercely modern in their application, social networks in some ways take us back to the politics of the village square. 
They are an electronic word of mouth on a sometimes global scale. This has changed the way people interact with each other and with their politicians. My first campaign as spokesman and strategist for Tony Blair was in 1997, three years in the planning after he had become leader of the Opposition  Labour Party. Some of the principles of strategy we applied back then would certainly apply to a modern day election. But their tactical execution almost certainly would not. Politicians and their strategists have to adapt to change as well as lead it. Seguela gives some interesting insights into those who have adapted well, and those who have done less well. He clearly adores former President Lula of Brazil and you can feel his yearning for a French leader who can somehow combine hard-headed strategy with human empathy in the same way as a man who left office with satisfaction ratings of 87percent. Seguela probably remains best known in political circles for his role advising Francois Mitterrand. 
Yet wheras I am 'tribal Labour', and could not imagine supporting a Conservative Party candidate in the UK, Seguela came out as a major supporter of Nicolas Sarkozy. I wonder if one of the reasons was not a frustration that large parts of the left in France remain eternally suspicious of modern communications techniques and styles which, frankly, no modern leader in a modern democracy can ignore. How he or she adapts to, or uses, them is up to them.'''
